### Getting the VM up and running

  * Download and install VirtualBox from the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). This is the tool the runs the virtual machine for you. 
  * Download the BCE VM in the form of an OVA file from [UNDER CONSTRUCTION](BCE-xubuntu-14.04-amd64.ova).
  * Open VirtualBox and import the BCE-xubuntu-14.04-amd64.ova file you just downloaded by going to "File->Import Appliance" and then selecting the .ova file from wherever you downloaded it to (possible 'Downloads' in your home directory on the machine). 
  * Wait a few minutes...
  * Start the virtual machine by clicking on the tab for "BCE-xubuntu-14.04-amd64" on the left side and then clicking "Start" at the top. This will start a virtual Linux computer within your own machine. After a few seconds you should see black screen and then soon you'll see the desktop of the VM.

You now have a machine that has all the software installed as part of BCE, including IPython and useful Python packages and R, RStudio and useful R packages.

You can get a terminal window that allows you to type commands in a UNIX-style shell by clicking on the icon of the black box with the $ symbo on the top panel. Using this you can start IPython Notebook by simply typing "ipython notebook" or  R by simply typing 'R' at the prompt in the terminal. This starts a bare-bones R session. To start RStudio, either type 'rstudio' at the prompt on go to "Applications->Programming->RStudio".

You can restart the VM at any time by opening VirtualBox and clicking on the tab for the VM and clicking "Start" as you did above.

### Sharing folders and copying files between your computer and the VM

One useful thing will be to share folders between the VM and the host machine so that you can access the files on your computer from the VM. Do the following:
  * Got to "Devices->Shared Folder Settings" and click on the icon of a folder with a "+" on the right side.
  * Select a folder to share, e.g. your home directory on your computer by clicking on "Folder Path" and choosing "Other" and navigating to the folder of interest. For our purposes here, assume we click on "Documents".
  * Click "make permanent" and "auto-mount" and then click "Ok".
  * Reboot the machine by going to applications button on the left of the top toolbart, clicking on "Log Out", and choosing "Restart" in the window that pops up.
  * Once the VM is running again, click on the "Shared" folder on the desktop. You should see the folder "sf_Documents" (or whatever the folder name you selected was, in place of 'Documents'). You can drag and drop files to manipulate them.
  * Alternatively, from the Terminal, you can also see the directory by doing "cd ~/Desktop/shared/sf_Documents" and then "ls" will show you the files. 
Be careful: unless you selected "read only" at the same time as "make permanent", any changes to the shared folder on the VM affects the folder in the 'real world', namely your computer. 

For those of you familiar with ssh and scp and sftp, you can access the VM directly from a Terminal on your computer (the host) as follows:
<code>
ssh -l oski -p 6422 localhost"
</code>
